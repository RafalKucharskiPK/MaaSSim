    "\n",
    "In this paper, we investigate how the  pricing of ride-pooling affects driver earnings. We also examine how profit-based setting affects these performance indicators. To this end, we applied a matching algorithm  to the case of ride-pooling and give a choice set to the driver for the case of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. For our simulation, we utilize an agent-based simulator reproducing the transport systems for two-sided mobility platforms (like Uber and Lyft) and applied three state-of-the-art pricing strategies such as <strong>profit maximization</strong>,  <strong>solo ride-hailing</strong>, and <strong>nearest pickup ride-pooling</strong>. We find that the profit maximization pricing strategy outperforms the other and traveler utility can be further improved by $\\%X$ while reducing the total cost to serve the pooled rides. While offering a discount for profit maximization travel time is significantly higher $\\%X$  than for private rides. \n",
